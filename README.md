# Gadget

## Billy Mays here, do you hate:
- Bookmarking the same URL across devices?
- Having to click to get to the ticket you're looking for?
- Having to remember random websites?

**Then do I have good news for you!**

Gadget is a fun new service/website that helps solve these problems!

Imagine you're trying to get to a nasty bug. Going to JIRA, clicking on the text box, pasting in the ticket number. So much work! Now with `gadget` you can go right there! Just go to `go/jira BUG-1234` in you're browser and BOOM. It's like a new URL shows up in the browser just where you want to be!

Are you tired of setting a bookmark, just to have it be updated next week!? Well then, good news! Instead of managing those pesky bookmarks. Share a single "go link" or "gadget link" and then no one ever has to update a bookmark again! Throught the magic of [`307 Redirects`](https://httpstatuses.com/307). You will always end up at the right location. Let the Bob's change the URL all they want. Everyone gets the update in seconds with no work!

What are you waiting for, try Gadget at [gto.cx/dog](https://gto.cx/dog) today!
